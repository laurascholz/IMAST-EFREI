<h3>Our Sources</h3>
<article>
    The <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/growth/tools-databases/cosing/index.cfm">  CosIng Database </a> is used for the classification of a cosmetic product's ingredients into harmful and harmless ingredients. This database from the European Commission contains information on cosmetic substances and ingredients. <br /> 
    <i>Article 19(1)(g) of Regulation (EC) No 1223/2009 </i> requires that the information on the label of cosmetic products must include a list of ingredients. The ingredients should be indicated using the common name of the ingredients listed in a glossary established and updated by the Commission in accordance with Article 33 of that Regulation. <br />
    As these common ingredient names can also be found in the CosIng Database, it is suitable for the evaluation of ingredients of cosmetic products. Cometic Check accesses the data on restricted ingredients, colorants, UV filters and preservatives to categorize harmful or harmless ingredients.
